# Hat of Names
A program written in c for picking (pseudo)random names out a text file.
## Restrictions
File must contain only ASCII characters.
## Installation
Clone the repository and compile `main.c` with the compiler of your choice.
## Usage
To run the program, use the executable created by the compiler, and add the path to the file you wish to use after the executable.
Example:

```command 
hofn.sh /home/user/students.txt
```

To pull a random name, use `p`. If all the names have been pulled, the program ends.
